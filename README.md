A customizable macOS menubar timer app designed to remind you to take breaks and stretch regularly. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, it helps you stay focused while maintaining your physical well-being.

## Features

- **Customizable Intervals**: Set your own focus and break durations (from 1 minute to 8 hours for focus, 1 minute to 1 hour for breaks)
- **Timer Presets**: Quick access to common timer configurations (Pomodoro, Short Work, Long Work)
- **Auto-cycle Mode**: Automatically loop through focus and break sessions indefinitely
- **Appearance Modes**: Choose between System, Light, or Dark appearance
- **Context Menu**: Right-click the menubar icon for quick access to timer controls and settings
- **Visual Feedback**: At-a-glance status from the menubar icon
